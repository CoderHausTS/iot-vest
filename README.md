# iot-vest

This repository contains the code and documentation for a technical product built using various small edge and IoT devices, such as Nvidia Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi, ESP32, Zigbee, Arduino, etc., integrated into a tactical style vest. The code in this repository is primarily written in C++.

## Overview
The IOT Vest is designed to provide advanced functionality and capabilities to users wearing the vest. It combines the power of edge computing, wireless communication, and sensor integration to enable real-time data processing and decision-making in multiple scenarios.

The main components of the system include:

- Nvidia Jetson Nano: This high-performance embedded computing platform serves as the central processing unit, running complex algorithms and managing data processing tasks.
- Raspberry Pi: The Raspberry Pi is utilized for general-purpose computing and acts as a bridge between various devices and the Jetson Nano.
- ESP32 devices: These microcontrollers are used for wireless communication and sensor data collection. They provide connectivity and facilitate data transmission between the vest and external devices.
- Zigbee: Zigbee technology is leveraged for establishing wireless communication and control between the vest and other compatible devices.
- Arduino: Arduino microcontrollers are employed for specific hardware control and interfacing with sensors and actuators.
